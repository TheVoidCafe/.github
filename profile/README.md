## Welcome to "The Void Cafe" ðŸ‘‹
We are a group of individuals from Germany and the UK, working on Bonelab mods and Webapps in our free time, whenever we feel like it.
As such, please don't pressure any members to provide support and/or updates for their projects.

That's it, you can check out our repositories from within the repositories tab at the top.

## For developers
### Bonelab modding
If you have worked with Unity before, and are interested in Bonelab modding, feel free to submit pull-request to any of our public repositories.
It should be noted that we are still beginners in terms of Unity knowledge, and mistakes will be made during the development of our projects, please do feel free to open an issue if you have any complaints or improvements in mind.

## Licensing
We strive to keep our work open and accessible for everyone, at all times.
There will be exceptions, however.

For information regarding a specific project, please consult the attached README.
