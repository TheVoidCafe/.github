## Welcome to "The Void CafÃ¨" ðŸ‘‹
We are a group of individuals from Germany and the UK, working on Bonelab mods in our free time, whenever we feel like it.
As such, please don't pressure any members to provide support and/or updates for their projects.

That's it, you can check out our repositories from within the repositories tab at the top.

## For developers
If you have worked with Unity before, and are interested in Bonelab modding, feel free to submit pull-request to any of our public repositories.
As of August 2024, I (Jo) guarantee that all of our current and future repositories will be released under the "MIT" license, that way, anyone may use parts of our projects in their own, and we get to enjoy a more open development experience.

It should be noted that we are still beginners in terms of Unity knowledge, and mistakes will be made during the development of our projects, please do feel free to open an issue if you have any complaints or improvements in mind.
